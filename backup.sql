correct, and then submit again to know I still have 3-5 errors.</p><p>Put errors beside the one that needs to correct, and put good description so the user knows what needs to be done, and better put border color around the input field so the user knows which input fields are not correct.</p><p>...and please don\'t keep me submitting 5 times to know which username is taken, provide me with information using Ajax if the username is taken.</p><h3>Some other tips.</h3><ul><li><strong>Use tabindex</strong></li><ul><li>Many people use the tab button to move from one input to another</li></ul><li><strong>Use title</strong></li><ul><li>It popup a tip about the current input field.</li></ul><li><strong>Set focus</strong></li><ul><li>With javascript you can put focus on the
